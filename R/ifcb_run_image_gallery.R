#' Run IFCB Image Gallery
#'
#' Launches a Shiny application that provides an interactive interface for
#' browsing and managing IFCB (Imaging FlowCytobot) image galleries.
#'
#' Users can specify a folder containing .png images, navigate through the images,
#' select and unselect images, and download a list of selected images.
#' This feature is particularly useful for quality control of annotated images.
#' A downloaded list of images from the app can also be uploaded to filter and
#' view only the selected images.
