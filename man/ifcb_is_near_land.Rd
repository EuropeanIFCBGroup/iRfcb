\title{Determine if Positions are Near Land}
\usage{
ifcb_is_near_land(
  latitudes,
  longitudes,
  distance = 100,
  shape = NULL,
  crs = 4326,
  utm_zone = 33,
  remove_small_islands = TRUE,
  small_island_threshold = 2e+06
)
}
\arguments{
\item{latitudes}{Numeric vector of latitudes for positions.}

\item{longitudes}{Numeric vector of longitudes for positions.}

\item{distance}{Buffer distance in meters around the coastline in meter. Default is 100 m.}

\item{shape}{Optional path to a shapefile containing coastline data. If provided,
the function will use this shapefile instead of reading rnaturalearth 1:10m vectors.
A more detailed shapefile allows for a smaller buffer distance.
Detailed European coastline can be downloaded as polygons from EEA at
\url{https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2/gis-data/eea-coastline-polygon}}

\item{crs}{Coordinate reference system (CRS) to use for positions and output.
Default is EPSG code 4326 (WGS84).}

\item{utm_zone}{UTM zone for buffering the coastline. Default is 33 (between 12°E and 18°E, northern hemisphere).}

\item{remove_small_islands}{Logical indicating whether to remove small islands from
the coastline. Default is TRUE.}

\item{small_island_threshold}{Area threshold in square meters below which islands
will be considered small and removed, if remove_small_islands is set to TRUE. Default is 2,000,000 sqm.}
}
\value{
Logical vector indicating whether each position is near land.
}
\description{
Determines whether given positions are near land based on a buffered coastline.
}
\details{
This function calculates a buffered area around the coastline and checks if
given positions (specified by longitudes and latitudes) are within this buffer
or intersect with land.

\examples{
# Define coordinates
latitudes <- c(62.500353, 58.964498, 57.638725, 56.575338)
longitudes <- c(17.845993, 20.394418, 18.284523, 16.227174)

# Call the function
near_land <- ifcb_is_near_land(latitudes, longitudes, distance = 300, crs = 4326)

# Print the result
print(near_land)
