\item{features_folder}{The directory containing .csv files, including subfolders, to be included in the zip archive.}

\item{class2use_file}{The path to the file (class2use_file) that will be renamed and included in the 'config' directory of the zip archive.}

\item{zip_filename}{The filename for the zip archive to be created.}

\item{data_folder}{Optionally, the directory containing additional data files (.roi, .adc, .hdr) to be included in the zip archive.}

\item{readme_file}{Optionally, the path to a README file that will be updated with metadata and included in the zip archive.}

\item{matlab_readme_file}{Optionally, the path to a MATLAB README file whose content will be appended to the end of the README file in the zip archive.}

\description{
This function creates a zip archive containing specified files and directories for manually
annotated IFCB images, organized into a structured format suitable for distribution or storage.
The MATLAB files are generated by the `ifcb-analysis` repository (Sosik and Olson 2007).
}
\details{
This function performs the following operations:
- Lists .mat files from `manual_folder`.
- Lists .csv files from `features_folder` (including subfolders).
- Lists .roi, .adc, .hdr files from `data_folder` if provided.
- Copies listed files to temporary directories (`manual_dir`, `features_dir`, `data_dir`, `config_dir`).
- Renames and copies `class2use_file` to `config_dir` as `class2use.mat`.
- Updates `readme_file` with metadata (if provided) and appends PNG image statistics and MATLAB README content.
- Creates a manifest file (`MANIFEST.txt`) listing all files in the zip archive.
- Creates a zip archive (`zip_filename`) containing all copied and updated files.
- Cleans up temporary directories after creating the zip archive.
