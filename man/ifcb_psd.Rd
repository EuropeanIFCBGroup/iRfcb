\usage{
ifcb_psd(
  feature_folder,
  hdr_folder,
  bins = NULL,
  save_data = FALSE,
  output_file = NULL,
  plot_folder = NULL,
  use_marker = FALSE,
  start_fit = 10,
  r_sqr = 0.5,
  beads = NULL,
  bubbles = NULL,
  incomplete = NULL,
  missing_cells = NULL,
  biomass = NULL,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_folder}{The absolute path to a directory containing all of the feature
files for the dataset (version can be defined in \code{fea_v}).}

\item{hdr_folder}{The absolute path to a directory containing all of the hdr files for
the dataset.}

\item{bins}{An optional character vector of bin names (e.g.,
\code{"D20251021T133007_IFCB134"}) to restrict processing to a specified subset of bins.
If \code{NULL} (default), all bins present in \code{feature_folder} are processed.}

\item{save_data}{A boolean indicating whether to save data to CSV files. Default is FALSE.}

\item{output_file}{A string with the base file name for the .csv output (including path).
Set to NULL to avoid saving data (default).}

\item{plot_folder}{The folder where graph images for each sample will be saved.
If \code{NULL} (default), plots are not saved. If \code{use_plot_subfolders = TRUE},
plots are organized into subfolders based on their flag status.}

\item{use_marker}{A boolean indicating whether to show markers on the plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{start_fit}{An integer indicating the start fit value for the plot. Default is 10.}

\item{r_sqr}{The lower limit of acceptable R^2 values (any curves below it will be flagged).
Default is 0.5.}

\item{beads}{The maximum multiplier for the curve fit. Any files with higher curve fit
multipliers will be flagged as bead runs. If this argument is included, files with
\code{"runBeads"} marked as TRUE in the header file will also be flagged. Optional.}

\item{bubbles}{The minimum difference between the starting ESD and the ESD with the most
targets. Files with a difference higher than this threshold will be flagged as mostly
bubbles. Optional.}

\item{incomplete}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the minimum volume of cells (in c/L)
and the minimum mL analyzed for a complete run. Files with values below these thresholds
will be flagged as incomplete. Optional.}

\item{missing_cells}{The minimum image count ratio threshold. Files with ratios below this
value will be flagged as missing cells. Optional.}

\item{biomass}{The minimum number of targets in the most populated ESD bin for any given run.
Files with fewer targets will be flagged as low biomass. Optional.}

\item{bloom}{The minimum difference between the starting ESD and the ESD with the most
targets. Files with a difference less than this threshold will be flagged as bloom events.
This threshold is usually lower than the bubbles threshold. Optional.}

\item{humidity}{The maximum percent humidity. Files with higher values will be flagged as
high humidity. Optional.}

\item{micron_factor}{The conversion factor to microns. Default is 1/3.4.}

\item{fea_v}{The version number of the IFCB feature file (e.g., 2, 4). Default is 2, as described in Hayashi et al. 2025. \ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}}

\item{use_plot_subfolders}{A boolean indicating whether to save plots in subfolders
based on the sample's flag status. If TRUE (default), samples without flags are
saved in a "PSD.OK" subfolder, and samples with flags are saved in subfolders
named after their flag(s). If FALSE, all plots are saved directly in \code{plot_folder}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{ggsave()}.
These override the default width, height, dpi, and background color
when saving plots. For example, \verb{width = 7, dpi = 300} can be supplied.}
}
\value{
A list containing three tibbles:
\describe{
\item{data}{A tibble with flattened PSD data for each sample.}
\item{fits}{A tibble containing curve fit parameters for each sample.}
\item{flags}{A tibble of flags for each sample, or NULL if no flags are found.}
}
The \code{save_data} parameter only controls whether CSV files are written to disk; the
function always returns this list.
}
\description{
This function generates and saves data about a dataset's Particle Size Distribution (PSD)
from Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) feature and hdr files, which can be used for data
quality assurance and quality control.
}
\details{
The PSD function originates from the \code{PSD} Python repository (Hayashi et al. 2025),
which can be found at \url{https://github.com/kudelalab/PSD}.

Python must be installed to use this function. The required Python packages can be
installed in a virtual environment using \code{ifcb_py_install()}.
