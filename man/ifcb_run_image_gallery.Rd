Launches a Shiny application that provides an interactive interface for
browsing and managing IFCB (Imaging FlowCytobot) image galleries.

Users can specify a folder containing .png images, navigate through the images,
select and unselect images, and download a list of selected images.
This feature is particularly useful for quality control of annotated images.
A downloaded list of images from the app can also be uploaded to filter and
view only the selected images.
