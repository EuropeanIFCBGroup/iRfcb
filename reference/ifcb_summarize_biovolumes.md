# Summarize Biovolumes and Carbon Content from IFCB Data

This function calculates aggregated biovolumes and carbon content from
Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) samples based on biovolume information from
feature files. Images are grouped into classes either based on MATLAB
classification, manually annotated files, or a user-supplied list of
images and their corresponding class labels (e.g. from a CNN model).

## Usage

``` r
ifcb_summarize_biovolumes(
  feature_folder,
  mat_folder = NULL,
  class2use_file = NULL,
  hdr_folder = NULL,
  custom_images = NULL,
  custom_classes = NULL,
  micron_factor = 1/3.4,
  diatom_class = "Bacillariophyceae",
  diatom_include = NULL,
  marine_only = FALSE,
  threshold = "opt",
  feature_recursive = TRUE,
  mat_recursive = TRUE,
  hdr_recursive = TRUE,
  drop_zero_volume = FALSE,
  feature_version = NULL,
  use_python = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- feature_folder:

  Path to the folder containing feature files (e.g., CSV format).

- mat_folder:

  (Optional) Path to the folder containing MATLAB classification or
  manual annotation files.

- class2use_file:

  (Optional) A character string specifying the path to the file
  containing the class2use variable (default NULL). Only needed when
  summarizing manual MATLAB results.

- hdr_folder:

  (Optional) Path to the folder containing HDR files. Needed for
  calculating cell, biovolume and carbon concentration per liter.

- custom_images:

  (Optional) A character vector of image filenames in the format
  DYYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_IFCBXXX_ZZZZZ, where "XXX" represents the IFCB number
  and "ZZZZZ" represents the ROI number. These filenames should match
  the `roi_number` assignment in the `feature_files` and can be used as
  a substitute for MATLAB files.

- custom_classes:

  (Optional) A character vector of corresponding class labels for
  `custom_images`.

- micron_factor:

  Conversion factor from microns per pixel (default: 1/3.4).

- diatom_class:

  A string vector of diatom class names in the World Register of Marine
  Species (WoRMS). Default is "Bacillariophyceae".

- diatom_include:

  Optional character vector of class names that should always be treated
  as diatoms, overriding the boolean result of `ifcb_is_diatom`.
  Default: NULL.

- marine_only:

  Logical. If TRUE, restricts the WoRMS search to marine taxa only.
  Default is FALSE.

- threshold:

  Threshold for classification (default: "opt").

- feature_recursive:

  Logical. If TRUE, the function will search for feature files
  recursively within the `feature_folder`. Default is TRUE.

- mat_recursive:

  Logical. If TRUE, the function will search for MATLAB files
  recursively within the `mat_folder`. Default is TRUE.

- hdr_recursive:

  Logical. If TRUE, the function will search for HDR files recursively
  within the `hdr_folder` (if provided). Default is TRUE.

- drop_zero_volume:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, rows where `Biovolume` equals zero (e.g.,
  artifacts such as smudges on the flow cell) are removed. Default:
  `FALSE`.

- feature_version:

  Optional numeric or character version to filter feature files by (e.g.
  2 for "\_v2"). Default is NULL (no filtering).

- use_python:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, attempts to read the `.mat` file using a
  Python-based method. Default is `FALSE`.

- verbose:

  A logical indicating whether to print progress messages. Default is
  TRUE.

## Value

A data frame summarizing aggregated biovolume and carbon content per
class per sample. Columns include 'sample', 'classifier', 'class',
'biovolume_mm3', 'carbon_ug', 'ml_analyzed', 'biovolume_mm3_per_liter',
and 'carbon_ug_per_liter'.

## Details

This function performs the following steps:

1.  Extracts biovolumes and carbon content from feature and
    classification results using `ifcb_extract_biovolumes`.

2.  Optionally incorporates volume data from HDR files to calculate
    volume analyzed per sample.

3.  Computes biovolume and carbon content per liter of sample analyzed.

The MATLAB classification or manual annotation files are generated by
the `ifcb-analysis` repository (Sosik and Olson 2007). Users can
optionally provide a **custom classification** by supplying a vector of
image filenames (`custom_images`) along with corresponding class labels
(`custom_classes`). This allows summarization of biovolume and carbon
content without requiring MATLAB classification or manual annotation
files (e.g. results from a CNN model).

Biovolumes are converted to carbon according to Menden-Deuer and Lessard
2000 for individual regions of interest (ROI), applying different
conversion factors to diatoms and non-diatom protists. If provided, the
function also incorporates sample volume data from HDR files to compute
biovolume and carbon content per liter of sample.

If `use_python = TRUE`, the function tries to read the `.mat` file using
[`ifcb_read_mat()`](https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/iRfcb/reference/ifcb_read_mat.md),
which relies on `SciPy`. This approach may be faster than the default
approach using
[`R.matlab::readMat()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/R.matlab/man/readMat.html),
especially for large `.mat` files. To enable this functionality, ensure
Python is properly configured with the required dependencies. You can
initialize the Python environment and install necessary packages using
[`ifcb_py_install()`](https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/iRfcb/reference/ifcb_py_install.md).
