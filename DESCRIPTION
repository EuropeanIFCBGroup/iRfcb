Description: A comprehensive suite of tools for managing, processing, and
    analyzing data from the IFCB. I R FlowCytobot ('iRfcb') supports
    quality control, geospatial analysis, and preparation of IFCB data for
    publication in databases like <https://www.gbif.org>,
    <https://www.obis.org>, <https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en>,
    <https://shark.smhi.se/en/>, and <https://www.ecotaxa.org>. The package
    integrates with the MATLAB 'ifcb-analysis' tool, which is described in
    Sosik and Olson (2007) <doi:10.4319/lom.2007.5.204>, and provides
    features for working with raw, manually classified, and machine
    learning–classified image datasets. Key functionalities include image
    extraction, particle size distribution analysis, taxonomic data
    handling, and biomass concentration calculations, essential for
    plankton research.
