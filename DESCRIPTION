Description: A comprehensive suite of tools for managing, processing, and analyzing data from the IFCB. I R FlowCytobot ('iRfcb') supports quality control, geospatial analysis, and preparation of IFCB data for publication in databases like <https://www.gbif.org>, <https://www.obis.org>, <https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en>, <https://shark.smhi.se/>, and <https://www.ecotaxa.org>. The package integrates with the MATLAB 'ifcb-analysis' tool, which is described in Sosik and Olson (2007) <doi:10.4319/lom.2007.5.204>, and provides features for working with raw, manually classified, and machine learningâ€“classified image datasets. Key functionalities include image extraction, particle size distribution analysis, taxonomic data handling, and biomass concentration calculations, essential for plankton research.
